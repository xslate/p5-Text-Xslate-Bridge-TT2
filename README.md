# CAVEAT

## Limitation of dynamic filters

All the dynamic filters require parens (i.e. to "call" them first),
even if you want to omit their arguments.

    [% FILTER repeat   # doesn't work! %]
    [% FILTER repeat() # works. %]

## Unsupported features

Filters that require Template-Toolkit context object are not supported,
which include `eval`, `evaltt`, `perl`, `evalperl` and `redirect`.

# DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.8.1 or later.

# BUGS
